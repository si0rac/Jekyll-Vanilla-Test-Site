### Exciting features or annoying complications?

_So far, so good._ I could do just about anything I wanted without having to bother with *complicated* **version control**.

There are, however, some big questions.

* Will this thing ever work with Tom Johnson's documentation theme? 
* Can we set it up?
* Is it any better than what Bitrise used so far?
* Can I convince the guys that it is better?

The backend setup in my config.yml file looks like this:
```
backend:
  name: github
  repo: si0rac/Jekyll-Vanilla-Test-Site # Path to your Github repository
  branch: master
```
